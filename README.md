## Data Upload
1. For easy data access among all teammates, we need to upload all data.
2. All data put into root folder which is shared for all to access
3. ALl data created for the same purpose need to be in one folder with its purpose as its name
Example (google drive file structure):
  - all_data/
    - original_data/
    - cleaned_data/
    - univariate_analysis/
    - etc...
4. Here is the link to root folder of [all_data](https://www.google.com)

## Code Upload
1. Same as Data, we need to share code written for whole team to see
2. Code should be in a .ipynb file, save to folder ./code/ in this github
3. All code need to be named with its purpose
4. If you have updated your file, update corresponding github file as well
Example (github file structure):
  - all_code/
    - data_clean_customer.ipynb
    - data_clean_item_transaction.ipynb
    - uni_analysis_customer.ipynb
    - etc...
